Original, unmodified benchmark:
56640	56765	56859	56532		avg = 56699

This is the time it takes to draw the default size window from a range of -.1, 1, -.1, 1.  All test use this.

13446 < best average so far, 23.7% of original

Ideas for increasing speed:

when moving or resizing, calculate all FractalPoint up front, store in hashtable with the points from the above array as the hash
